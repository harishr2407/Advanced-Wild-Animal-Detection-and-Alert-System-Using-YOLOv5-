# 🐾 Advanced Wild Animal Detection and Alert System Using YOLOv5

An intelligent real-time wild animal detection and alerting system using YOLOv5, integrated with Streamlit, OpenCV, sound alarms, email notifications, and location tracking. Designed to prevent human-wildlife conflict and safeguard agricultural and residential zones near forest areas.


## 📖 Overview

This project detects wild animals in real-time video streams using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm. When an animal is detected, the system:

- Raises a sound alarm
- Sends an email notification
- Tracks the current GPS location

## ✅ Features

- 🔍 Real-Time Detection using YOLOv5 and OpenCV  
- 🌐 Streamlit Interface for live video feed  
- 🚨 Sound Alarm Trigger using Pygame  
- 📧 Email Notifications using SMTP  
- 📍 GPS Location Detection using `geocoder`  
- 🐍 Fully built in Python for easy integration
